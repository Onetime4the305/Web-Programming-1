        <h2>Game Start</h2>
        <p>To start a game of crazy Eights, the deck must first be shuffled. After the deck is shuffled 5 cards should be distributed to each player and once this has been accomplished a final card should be placed in the middle to begin the game. Note: if the card placed in the middle possesses a rank of eight, it must be placed at the bottom of the deck pile and a new card should be selected because the game cannot begin with a card of that rank.
